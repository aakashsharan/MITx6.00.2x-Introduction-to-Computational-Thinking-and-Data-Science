# MITx-6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

###What is it?

A course offered every year from MIT on edx platform. This repository has the solutions for all of the problems sets, quiz and finals. As per the edx honor code we cannot post solutions online, so I have created a private repository on bitbucket.
